🏡 House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
Competition overview
Predict the sale price for residential homes in Ames, Iowa using a rich dataset of 79+ features—ranging from lot size and building year to neighborhood and condition—requiring advanced feature engineering and regression methods 


🎯 Objective
Build a model that accurately forecasts SalePrice for each property in the test set. Continuous evaluation via RMSE on a logarithmic scale encourages both precision and robustness .

📊 What makes this challenge valuable
This is a comprehensive, real‑world regression problem with complexities like:

Mixed data types: numerical, ordinal, nominal, and semi‑structured.

Missing values: some are informative (e.g., absence of a garage); others need standard imputation.

Feature skewness and outliers: requires transformations (e.g., log/Box–Cox) and careful handling.

Feature engineering opportunities: e.g., creating total area, total bathrooms, age-based features.

Modeling depth: from simple linear or tree-based models to ensembles and stacking 


🔧 Recommended approach
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Examine distributions, missing data patterns, feature correlations.

Data Cleaning & Imputation

Replace missing categorical values with “Missing” or mode, and numerical with mean/median 


Feature Engineering

Generate features like total square footage, age of the building, count of bathrooms, presence indicators (e.g., garage, fireplace) .

Transformations

Log-transform skewed numeric features (especially the target), apply Box–Cox or log1p where appropriate 


Encoding

Ordinal: map quality/condition ratings to numeric.

Nominal: one-hot encode low-cardinality features.

Modeling & Ensembling

Train baseline models: linear regression, Lasso, Ridge, etc.

Progress to tree-based methods: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost.

Boost performance with ensemble techniques (bagging, stacking, blending) 


Validation Strategy

Use K‑fold cross-validation on the log‑transformed target to control overfitting and evaluate generalization .
